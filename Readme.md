# Trader Behavior Insights â€” Market Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between trader performance and Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed) using two datasets:

- **Trader Execution Data**
- **Bitcoin Fear-Greed Index**

## Goals

- Understand how trader PnL, leverage, and trade behavior vary during Fear vs. Greed sentiment.
- Identify patterns that can lead to smarter trading strategies.

## Key Findings

- Traders performed **better/worse** during "Greed" periods based on average `closedPnL`.
- **Higher leverage** was more common during "Greed" but resulted in more volatility.
- Win rate was higher in "Fear" but with smaller average PnL.
